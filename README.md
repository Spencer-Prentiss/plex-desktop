## Plex Desktop

**Spencer Prentiss, 2022.**

Plex desktop application written in JavaScript using Electron.

Requires a Plex media server to function. Once Plex server is up  
and running, update _plexServer_ and _plexPort_ in [src/main.js](https://github.com/Spencer-Prentiss/plex-desktop/blob/master/src/main.js).

To run, use npm start. To build, use npm run build.  
Only current build/test target is Windows x64.  
Doesn't currently use webpack for build.
